Workflow:

- Before starting:
  - Ensure you're on the right branch for the feature you're working on with `git branch`. If not, use `git checkout` to switch to the right one.
  - `git pull origin master`, if relevant changes have been merged into the master branch since last work session
  - `git pull`
- Code away!
- When done:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "<Description of what you added>"`
  - `git push`
